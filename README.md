## a) What is the probability of serving exactly 3 cars?
## b) What is the probability of serving at least 3 cars?
## c) What is the probability of serving between 2 and 5 cars (inclusive)?
## d) Calculate and plot the PMF for the first 20 cars.
# Part4) Uniform distribution (15 points)
# Suppose that your exams are graded using a uniform distribution between 60 and 100 (both inclusive).
## a) What is the probability of scoring i) 60? ii) 80? iii) 100?
## b) What is the mean and standard deviation of this distribution?
## c) What is the probability of getting a score of at most 70?
## d) What is the probability of getting a score greater than 80 (use the lower.tail option)?
## e) What is the probability of getting a score between 90 and 100 (both inclusive)?
# Part5) Normal distribution (20 points)
# Suppose that visitors at a theme park spend an average of $100 on souvenirs. Assume that the money spent is normally distributed with a standard deviation of $10.
## a) Show the PDF of this distribution covering the three standard deviations on either side of the mean.
## b) What is the probability that a randomly selected visitor will spend more than $120?
## c) What is the probability that a randomly selected visitor will spend between $80 and $90 (inclusive)?
## d) What are the probabilities of spending within one standard deviation, two standard deviations, and three standard deviations, respectively?
## e) Between what two values will the middle 90% of the money spent will fall?
## f) Show a plot for 10,000 visitors using the above distribution.

## b) What is the probability that the next call will arrive within 5 minutes?
## c) What is the probability that the next call will arrive between 2 minutes and 5 minutes (both inclusive)?
## d) Show the CDF of this distribution.
